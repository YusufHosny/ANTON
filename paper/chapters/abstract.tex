This paper proposes a computer-vision based system to automate a ping-pong system capable of competing in real-time with a human player. The system incorporates a complex 2-degrees-of-freedom upright gantry mechanism with a generic networked control interface, allowing for hardware and software logic decoupling. The gantry is equipped with a swappable racket module which is controlled over a radio-frequency communication interface. Tracking the ball is achieved via a dual-camera side-view setup along with image masking and perspective projection to determine 3D positions in real-time. The proposed system is cost-effective, using readily available components such as consumer grade servos, a DC motor, and stepper motors. Furthermore, a supplementary companion app is provided which provides relevant user data, tracking information, and allows for manual control of the gantry and subsystems. The system presents a prototype for an efficient and cost effective proof of concept ping-pong system.
