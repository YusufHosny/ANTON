This paper proposes a computer-vision based system to automate a ping pong system capable of competing in real-time with a human player. The system will incorporate a simple upright gantry mechanism for precise and efficient 2D control. Tracking the ball is achieved via a dual-camera setup with a top and side view, to collect and compute 3 dimensional positional information for the ball. By integrating predictive algorithms to analyze the ball's trajectory and speed, the paddle is able to respond with accuracy and return the ball. The proposed system is cost-effective, using readily available components such as consumer grade servos, a solenoid, and stepper motors. Furthermore, a supplementary companion app is provided which provides relevant user data, tracking information, and game information.
