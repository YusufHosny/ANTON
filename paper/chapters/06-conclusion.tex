\chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper we explored the process of implementing a robust and reconfigurable adversarial ping-pong robot. We show that it is possible to develop a cheap ping-pong robot within some constraints, and provide solutions to any ongoing issues. We provided the basis for implementing a general purpose gantry with a reconfigurable and powerful software suite, and have shown the possibilities of real time ping-pong within computer vision.
