\chapter{Conclusion}
To conclude, in this paper we explore the process of implementing a robust and reconfigurable adversarial ping pong robot. We show that it is possible to develop a cheap ping pong robot within some constraints, and provide solutions to any ongoing issues. We provide the basis for implementing a general purpose gantry with a reconfigurable and powerful software suite, and show the possibilities of real time ping pong within computer vision.
