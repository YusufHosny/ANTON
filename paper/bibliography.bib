abstract={The moving target tracking is a very important in computer vision research topic and is widely used, it is of great research significance, has been widely used, and involved in image recognition, production automation, intelligent pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, weather information, and other fields, but in some high speed movement, such as target under complex background target trajectory when not much target tracking is still more difficult. This paper mainly studies the Kalman tracking algorithm of ping-pong robot based on fuzzy real-time image. For table tennis high-speed motion blurred images, air resistance and the camera imaging distortion caused by factors such as the error problem, puts forward an adaptive measurement covariance discrete Kalman trajectory estimation algorithm. The algorithm with dynamic adjustment of measuring the size of the covariance, has realized the accurate tracking of the target motion trajectory, and further laid the groundwork for table tennis balls prediction and hitting arm. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively overcome the interference of measurement noise and data loss and give excellent tracking results when the image acquisition rate is higher than 70 frames /s and the table tennis speed is higher than 5 m/s.},

abstract={Motion state ``Motion state of a ping-pong ball consists of the flying state and spin state.'' estimation and trajectory prediction of a spinning ball are two important but challenging issues for both the promotion of the next generation of robotic table tennis systems and the research on motion analysis of spinning-flying objects. Due to the Magnus force acting on the ball, the flying state ``Flying state denotes the real-time translational velocity.'' and spin state ``Spin state denotes the real-time rotational velocity.'' are coupled, which makes the accurate estimation of them a huge challenge. In this paper, we first derive the Extended Continuous Motion Model (ECMM) by clustering the trajectories into multiple categories with a K-means algorithm and fitting them respectively using Fourier series. The ECMM can easily adapt to all kinds of trajectories. Based on the ECMM, we propose a novel motion state estimation method using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which in result contributes to an accurate trajectory prediction. In this method, the category in ECMM is treated as a latent variable, and the likelihood of motion state is formulated as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of the differences between the trajectory predictions and observations. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method is verified by offline evaluation using a collected dataset, as well as online evaluation that the humanoid robotic table tennis system ``Wu {\&} Kong'' successfully hits the high-speed spinning ball.},
